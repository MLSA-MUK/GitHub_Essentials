# Git and GitHub Advanced Exercises

These exercises will challenge you to apply your knowledge in practical scenarios and build your expertise.

## Exercise 1: Advanced Git Commands

**Task:** Practice using advanced Git commands to manipulate your repository's history and resolve complex scenarios.

1. **Interactive Rebase:** Use interactive rebase to squash multiple commits into one and reword commit messages.

2. **Cherry-Pick:** Cherry-pick a commit from one branch and apply it to another branch.

3. **Stash:** Stash your changes, switch branches, and then apply the stash to continue your work.

4. **Reflog:** Use the reflog to recover a lost commit or branch.

5. **Bisect:** Employ the Git bisect tool to identify the exact commit where a bug was introduced in your project.

## Exercise 2: Advanced GitHub Collaboration

**Task:** Challenge yourself with advanced collaboration scenarios on GitHub.

1. **Participate in an Open-Source Project:** Find a public open-source project on GitHub and contribute to it following their guidelines.

2. **Collaborative Code Review:** Work with a teammate to set up a comprehensive code review process for a repository, including commenting, suggesting changes, and approving pull requests.

3. **CI/CD Integration:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the testing and deployment process for a repository. Ensure it includes appropriate security scanning and notifications.

4. **Project Management:** Organize a GitHub Project board for a sample project, including columns for tasks, prioritization, and automation using GitHub Actions.

## Exercise 3: Git and GitHub Best Practices

**Task:** Apply advanced Git and GitHub best practices to improve your development workflow.

1. **Git Hooks:** Implement custom Git hooks to enforce coding standards or prevent specific actions in your repository.

2. **Branch Protection Rules:** Define branch protection rules on your GitHub repository to safeguard the main branch and enforce code reviews and status checks.

3. **Security Scanning:** Integrate a security scanning tool into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for vulnerabilities in your code.

4. **Git Configurations:** Optimize your Git configuration settings, including aliases and global settings, to enhance productivity.
